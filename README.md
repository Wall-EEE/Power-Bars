## Power Bars

1. **Development environment setup:** If you haven't already, ensure your development environment is set up with Java, Git, and an IDE (preferably IntelliJ).

2. **Create a project directory:** Within the RuneLite's plugin folder, create a new directory called 'power-bars'.

3. [ ]Create the necessary plugin files.** Start by creating these four starting files:
    - `PowerBarsPlugin.java:` This is your primary plugin class where your main logic will reside. It will need to fetch the player's status from RuneLite's API and then display them appropriately.
    - `PowerBarsConfig.java:` This file should define any configuration options your plugin will have, such as display style or positioning choices.
    - `PowerBarsPluginTest.java:` Here, you can write tests to make sure your plugin works as intended.
    - `plugin.properties:` Here, mention the basic details about your plugin – its name, version, description, etc.

4. **Implement your plugin’s logic:** In `PowerBarsPlugin.java`, your code should:
    - Fetch the player's status (health, stamina, prayer) from the game.
    - Convert these status values into your desired graphical representation.
    - Position and render these representations in the player's UI.

5. **Test your plugin:** Use `PowerBarsPluginTest.java` to check if your plugin is showing the bars correctly and updating them in real-time as expected.

6. **Publish Your Plugin:** Once you are satisfied that your plugin works as expected, you can publish it. To do so, you’ll need to create a new release that matches the version scheme in your `plugin.properties` file.

As you work through these steps, don't hesitate to ask if you have questions or if you encounter problems. Would you also like advice on how to implement your code or strategies for testing your plugin?
